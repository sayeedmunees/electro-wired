## Kindly to your attention
This website is developed as a part of our mini-project Armbot, which could be used for Warehouse automation. It could be used to arrange a warehouse by determining the size and shape of a box or cargo. The project hasn't fully finished yet it's under progression. Currently, we don't intend to take it to market; maybe we will in the future. 

Thanks for checking out!

## Also to note
This is desktop-first workflow and I haven't yet optimised it for any other devices. Soon I will be making it responsive.
Thank you <3
